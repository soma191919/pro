<p>Classic : 
	<pre>     
  Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western culture, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music.
  While a more precise term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period),
  this article is about the broad span of time from before the 6th century AD to the present day, which includes the Classical period and
  various other periods.</pre></p>

<p>POP :
	<pre>

 Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the United States and United Kingdom during the mid-1950s.
 [4] The terms "popular music" and "pop music" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular 
 and includes many diverse styles. "Pop" and "rock" were roughly synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they became increasingly
 differentiated from each other.
